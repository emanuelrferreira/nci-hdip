        <h2>NCI - HDIP in Science in Computing (Software Development)</h2>
        <p>
          This exam was hammered together purely for personal learning, caffeine shakes, and the occasional existential crisis.<br><br>
          Created by brunkonjaa with the help of Notepad++, TextPad, VSCode, and a sometimes cooperative AI (ChatGPT). Built on bucketloads of coffee, the odd slab of tiramisu, and I just have to mention cannelloni, do not ask why...<br><br>
		  Truth be told, I havent the faintest idea about coding. I just know how to bash the keys til the thing coughs up the right answer. Picture it: me standing outside some god-forsaken pub in the middle of nowhere, the sign swinging in the wind, only a limping hen and a deaf donkey for company on the side of the road. I am there mumbling about Java syntax like it is gospel, but in reality, I am just hoping nobody asks me how it actually works. The donkey does not judge, the hen just stares - and that is about the level of feedback I can handle.<br><br>
          It is probably riddled with wrong answers, half-baked logic, and the occasional coding sin.<br><br>
          So take it as practice, not gospel. This is definitely not official exam material.<br>
          Use at your own peril - and may you have more correct answers than empty cups of coffee. <br><br>
		  Happy hunting Peeps!!!<br><br>
