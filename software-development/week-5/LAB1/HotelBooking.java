Develop an application that allows the user to book a hotel room. The user should be asked for their name, the required number of nights, and their age. The application should assume that each room costs 90 euro per night and then calculate and output the total cost to confirm the booking. Please note: a booking can only be confirmed if the user is at least 18.
