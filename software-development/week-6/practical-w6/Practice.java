/*
Loops: Practical Work
The following are a set of simple exercises that will cement the basics of Loop structures. Feel free to do all of these in 1 file for ease of coding/testing. Make sure to comment each exercise as this file will serve as a good study guide later.

Print all numbers 1-100
Print all numbers 100-0
Print all numbers between -10 and +10
Take in 2 numbers from a user and print all numbers between these 2
Take in 3 numbers from a user and use them to set all 3 parts of the loop and print (Eg 1,10,2 would print from 1-10 in increments of 2)
Optional Exercises (Advanced)

Calculate the sum of all numbers 1-10 (1+2+3 etc)
Calculate the sum of all even numbers 1-100 and all odd numbers 1-100 (1+3+5 etc and 2+4+6 etc)
Write a loop that takes in 5 numbers from a user and outputs the sum of all inputted numbers
Write a loop that takes in 2 numbers from a user and raises the first number to the power of the second
